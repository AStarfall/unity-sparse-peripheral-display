## Introduction

The **Unity Sparse Peripheral Display** project explores a novel approach to enhance the virtual reality experience by utilizing LEDs to extend the field of view (FoV). By intelligently integrating these LEDs and controlling them, the project aims to create a more immersive and engaging VR environment.

## Features

- **LED Integration:** Use LED technology to create a sparse peripheral display and offer a wider FoV.
- **Demo Scene:** Included demo scene showcases the concept of sparse peripheral display.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed for seamless integration into existing Unity VR projects.
- **Customizability:** Adapt LED configurations, colors, and placement to your specific needs.
